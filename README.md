# Anomaly-detection-in-online-betting-
The project aims to detect suspicious betting activities like match-fixing using deep learning. Using features like goal difference and probabilities, four models Autoencoder, DFFNN, GNN, and LEM were tested. LEM achieved 92% accuracy, proving graph and embedding methods enhance anomaly detection in football betting.
